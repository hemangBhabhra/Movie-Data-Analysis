# 🎬 Movie Data Analysis and Visualization

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on a raw movie dataset of over **9,800 entries**, sourced from Netflix and other public datasets. The objective is to clean and transform the data, uncover key industry trends, and visualize audience preferences.

---

## 📊 Overview

- **Cleaned and processed** raw movie data by handling missing values and restructuring genre information.
- **Engineered new features** by categorizing movie ratings into qualitative tiers (e.g., *Popular*, *Average*, *Below Average*).
- Conducted in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in genres, top-rated films, and audience vote patterns.
- Built informative visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to communicate findings clearly.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Visualization

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemangBhabhra/Movie-Data-Analysis.git
   cd Movie-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Netflix Analysis New.ipynb"
   ```

3. Run all cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Turn visual analysis into an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Dash**
- Integrate filters for genre, year, or country
- Use APIs for fetching up-to-date movie datasets
